- **File System Hierarchy**: Familiarizing yourself with the Linux directory structure (e.g., /bin, /etc, /home) and the purpose of each directory.
- **Basic Commands**: Mastering essential commands like `ls` (list directory contents), `cp` (copy files), `mv` (move/rename files), `rm` (remove files), `cat` (concatenate and display files).

### 2. Command-Line Proficiency

- **File System Navigation**: Using commands like `cd` (change directory), `pwd` (print working directory), and `ls`.
- **Text Editors**: Proficiency in text editors like `vi`, `vim`, and `nano` for editing configuration files and scripts.
- **Standard I/O**: Understanding how to use `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr`, and how to redirect output using `>`, `>>`, and `2>`.
- **Piping and Redirection**: Combining commands with `|` to pass output from one command as input to another.
- **Process Management**: Using `ps` (process status), `top` (real-time process monitoring), `kill` (terminate processes).

### 3. Shell Scripting

- **Basics of Bash Scripting**: Writing and executing simple scripts, understanding shell syntax.
- **Variables and Arrays**: Using variables to store data, and arrays for lists of values.
- **Control Structures**: Implementing conditional statements (`if`, `else`) and loops (`for`, `while`).
- **Functions**: Writing reusable code blocks with functions.
- **Task Automation**: Automating routine tasks with scripts, such as backups and system monitoring.

### 4. Package Management

- **APT (Debian-based)**: Using `apt-get`, `apt-cache`, and `dpkg` for package management.
- **YUM/DNF (Red Hat-based)**: Managing packages with `yum` or `dnf`.
- **Installing, Updating, and Removing Software**: Performing software installation, updates, and removals.

- **Network Tools**: Using tools like `ping` (check connectivity), `netstat` (network statistics), `traceroute` (trace network path).
- **DNS and Host Files**: Configuring DNS settings and managing `/etc/hosts` for local hostname resolution.
- **SSH**: Securely accessing remote machines with SSH, setting up key-based authentication, and using `scp` for secure file transfers.

### 6. Security and Permissions

- **User and Group Management**: Creating and managing users and groups with `useradd`, `groupadd`, `usermod`, and `groupmod`.
- **Permissions and Ownership**: Using `chmod` to change file permissions, `chown` to change file ownership, and understanding permission symbols (r, w, x).
- **Sudo**: Configuring and using `sudo` for elevated privileges.
- **SELinux/AppArmor**: Implementing advanced security policies with SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) or AppArmor.

### 7. File Systems and Storage

- **Understanding File Systems**: Familiarity with ext4, xfs, btrfs, and others.
- **Mounting and Unmounting**: Using `mount` and `umount` commands to attach and detach file systems.
- **Disk Partitions**: Managing partitions with `fdisk` or `parted`.
- **LVM (Logical Volume Manager)**: Setting up and managing LVM for flexible disk management.

### 8. System Monitoring and Performance Tuning

- **System Performance Monitoring**: Using `top`, `htop`, `iostat`, and `sar` for monitoring system performance.
- **Log Management**: Managing system logs with `journald` and `syslog`.
- **Performance Tuning**: Tweaking system parameters for optimal performance.

### 9. Automated Task Scheduling

- **Cron Jobs**: Creating and managing scheduled tasks with `cron`.
- **Crontab**: Using `crontab -e` to edit the crontab file, understanding cron syntax.
- **Anacron**: Setting up tasks with `anacron` for systems that are not continuously running.

### 10. Backup and Recovery

- **Creating Backups**: Using tools like `rsync` for incremental backups, `tar` for archiving files, and `dd` for disk cloning.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Implementing disaster recovery plans and testing backups.

### 11. Virtualization and Containers

- **Basics of Virtualization**: Understanding virtualization concepts with KVM, VirtualBox.
- **Docker Fundamentals**: Installing Docker, creating and managing Docker containers and images.
- **Dockerfile**: Writing Dockerfiles for automated builds.
- **Container Management**: Using `docker-compose` for managing multi-container applications.

### 12. Advanced Command-Line Tools

- **Text Processing**: Using `grep` for searching, `sed` for stream editing, and `awk` for pattern scanning and processing.
- **File Management**: Managing files and directories with `find`, `locate`, and `xargs`.
- **Network Configuration and Troubleshooting**: Advanced usage of `ifconfig`, `ip`, `netstat`, and `traceroute`.

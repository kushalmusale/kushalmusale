Questions to Tareeq 
About current project, process, how it is implemented, your roles and responsibilites, daily tasks, challenges you faced, about agile(how agile is followed by Devops team or how agile is implemented for Devops team, what type of stories/tasks will be given to Devops team, etc.) 

Project about microservices for resume - real time apps, which you have worked - how many microservices did that project had or how many microservices project you have worked in real time - in my resume, how many microservices project I can put and explain them 

* please can you give and expain me few real time projects of yours, so that I can put in my resume - because for 4+ years exp. candidates, projects matters a lot for shortlisting and in interview starting questions will be about projects 

What type of issues usually Devops engineer will get to work on - in which areas/tools - like in Jenkins, pipeline, K8S, build related or which areas - how to fix those issues/tasks 

===============
Understand what DevOps is and DevOps principles and practices 
What is SDLC, Agile and Devops 
KPI - creating work in your current role - e.g. find out any technical dent in your project if possible, drive them end to end - this triggers your leadership qualities
What leadership looks - 
Take initiatives in your current role(don't be content with what you are doing or whatever is assigned to you) - Find problems which are there in your existing setup and nobody is looking to it - bring it to your managers - work on it 
Be a mentor people around you (juniors, teammates, or to anybody) - also be "Menti" - ask for mentorship from any seniors how to handle large scale projects or anything to learn and work on 
Collaboration - you need to collaborate with different teams across multiple domains in your company 
Take feedbacks - and work on it and improve yourself in all areas/aspects - this gives good impression about how serious you are about the work 
Become what you seek (think of what you want to be - in which position you want to be in) 

*Deliver high quality work always - this is the 1st point ***  
Be visible - whatever work you are doing - even if you do small things, ensure that necessary communication goes out to espically to your managers, stakeholders and others to know what you are doing - try to be mentor to juniors or others 
===
Be sure that whatever you put in your resume you are 100% confident on that - be answerable to questions whatever you have put in your resume, put whatever you know, you are confident at
===
- System administration skills - very very strong fundamentals of Linux 
- Bash scripting - single line basch script - given log file and filter out the unique IP addresses - learn to write one-liner bash scripts 
- Programming - Python (Python scripting) 
- Cloud platform - good knowledge of any cloud platform 
- Troubleshooting and debugging skills - your approach - while opening a website you will get 502 error - how would you troubleshoot this error - understand the internal things - understand what's the root cause and where to look for the solution and how to fix it 
-* knowledge of your current project on which your are working / current application your are supporting - in and out of that thing - how is your app deployed, how do we do CICD for that perticular app, how do you monitor that app, how would you do updates for that perticular app 

- IaC - Terraform, CloudFormation 
- Container technology - Docker 
- Config management tool - Ansible 
- K8S - how K8S is implemented, how it is implemented 
- Monitoring and logging - ELK, Prometheus and Grafana 
- Security - understand the complete life-cycle of app security 
- Agile - to track the work - Devops/operations agile - follow the agile methodology - Sprints for operations/Devops team, stories(perticular task broken down into stories) for perticular release - agile methodology is implemented even for the operations team 

- CICD - how you build pipelines 

-* Focus on concepts like high-availability, fault tolerence, networking 
- Understand the tech stack of your company, every company will have different tech stack 
-* built infrastructure for AI/ML apps to run 

How would i learn devops from scratch today | Career in DevOps - 
- Learn the fundamentals, core principles and practices of DevOps

Mistakes to avoid on the devops career path!
============================================
- Over-Automate - what to automate and what not to automate 
- Do not bypass security group rules in your infrastructure just to get things done - e.g. just to get ssh access to a server or may be opening some port to hit the app on the browser 
- Ignoring technical debts(decks) - please have a story/task for you in Jira or whatever ticketing system or whatever project management tool you are using - fix that technical debt story/task later or in next sprint or release to know that something you did and you have to fix 
- Not communicating enough/properly(even though you have very good technical skills)- after doing a task(e.g. doing 10 hrs task in 2 hrs), inform to the stakeholders, managers or others 
- A thirsy for trendy tools - try to work/play on any tool or technology 
- Not keeping the documentation updated - about what you are doing, done, about to do, keep org. docs updated so that it will be helpful for other after me, new joiners, new team members 
- Never be shy in for asking help
